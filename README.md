# My-Ethicalhacking-projects
As a passionate Software Engineer and un Ethical hacker, this repository will be containing my hacking projects. 
I am Mwesigye Nicholas I graduated as un orthopeadic medical clinicial from Mugalo paramedical school Uganda, but as I continued with this journey I realised that technology was holding the future
from then I decided to enter tech and my goal from then was to be the best version of myself in Ethical hacking and software engineering.
growing in a third world country where techology is just developing, demand for software engineers increasing and cyber-attacks increasing I decided to specialise in these two areas 
so as to design customised software and protect my country against cyber-attacks
