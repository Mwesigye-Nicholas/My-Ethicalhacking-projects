# My-Ethicalhacking-projects
As a passionate Software Engineer and un Ethical hacker, this repository will be containing my hacking projects. 
I am Mwesigye Nicholas I graduated as un orthopeadic medical clinicial from Mugalo paramedical school Uganda, but as I continued with this journey I realised that technology was holding the future
from then I decided to enter tech and my goal from then was to be the best version of myself in Ethical hacking and software engineering.
growing in a third world country where techology is just developing, demand for software engineers increasing and cyber-attacks increasing I decided to specialise in these two areas 
so as to design customised software and protect my country against cyber-attacks

I build my hacking lab containing metasploitable2, windows 10 xp, kali and parrot machines.
I will be starting my hacking project with exploiting the metasploitable2 machine.

STEP 1:
I started by attacking the smtp protocol running on port 25 on my target machine.
I started by pinging the target machine to see whether the machine is up.

STEP 2:
Scanning the target machine targetting specifically port 25 to confirm that its running smtp because sometime misconfigurations can occur.

STEP 3:
Now we open up our metasploit frame.
